            <h3>Childhood</h3>
            <p>Over 2300 years ago, in ancient times, a young prince was born in Macedonia. His name was Alexander.
                While growing up, he was taught by many people, and one of them was the great aristotle. He was only taught
                by aristotle for 3 years. He did have other teachers as well, ones that taught him about war and ones that 
                taught him about being a king. When he was 19 years old his father died.
