            <p>Over 2300 years ago, in ancient times, a young prince was born in Macedonia. His name was Alexander.
                While growing up, he was taught by many people, and one of them was the great aristotle. He was only taught
                by aristotle for 3 years. He did have other teachers as well, ones that taught him about war and ones that 
                taught him about being a king. When he was 19 years old his father died.

            <h2 id="ruler-life">Life as a Ruler</h2>
            <p>When Alexander would conquer an area he would not force the greek religion on the people, instead he would build schools teaching the greek
               religion. That may seem nice, but he had a darkside, whenever something wouldn't go his way he would flip out, sometimes hiding in his tent 
               for days. Soemtimes he would even murder advisors or friends.

            <h2 id="greek-influence">How Alexander and the Greek Culture Influenced our Lives</h2>
            <p>One way he influenced our lives is he included botanists and scientists in his armies to study the lands he conquered. He also named most of
               the areas he conquered after himself so now some people live in areas that were named after Alexander. This was not from alexander but the greeks
               also influence what gods we have studied or even believe in.

            <p>After a feirce battle, Alexander the Great died on June 323 B.C. at the age of only 32! Some historians believe that he died of malaria or a
               natural disease, while others who believe he was poisoned. His last words were “Bury my body, do not build any monument, keep my hands outside
               so that the world knows the person who won the world had nothing in his hands when dying“.
